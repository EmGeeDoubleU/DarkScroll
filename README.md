## Overview

**DarkScroll** is a lightweight, open-source Chrome extension designed to reduce time spent on YouTube by eliminating flashy thumbnails and clickbait.

We've all been trapped in the YouTube vortex — one thumbnail leads to another, and suddenly an hour's gone. DarkScroll breaks that cycle by replacing all video thumbnails with a plain black square.


Here’s what YouTube looks like with **DarkScroll** running — distraction-free and clean:
